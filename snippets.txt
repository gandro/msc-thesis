## query design (or impl)

TODO This is the description of a query from the user perspective. How does the
coordinator see it?

\subsection{Submission}

The compilation of a query's source code into a runnable binary is done
at the client side. This allows the user to link against arbitrary
libraries which they might use in their query program.
