\chapter{Timely Dataflow}\label{ch:background}

Timely Dataflow \cite{timely} (\textquote{Timely}) is a Rust library for writing distributed,
cyclic dataflow programs. It is a modular implementation of the timely dataflow
model introduced by Naiad \cite{naiad}. 

\section{Computational Model}

Timely Dataflow is a framework for writing dataflow programs. Dataflow programs
are programs where the execution model can represented as a directed graph, with data
flowing along edges and vertice. Notable features of Naiad and
Timely Dataflow are: Support for structured loops, stateful vertices and the
options for vertices to be notified if given input rounds are completed. \cite{naiad}

\subsection{Programming Interface}

The Timely Dataflow library provides a domain-specific language for expressing
dataflow graphs in Rust. Users instantiate operators (vertices) and connect
them using stream handles (edges). Many operators accept user-provided functions
