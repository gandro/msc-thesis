\chapter*{Abstract}

Online processing of data streams is an increasingly
common task in many applications. This motivates the use of platforms which
not only perform the submission and execution of different computational tasks,
but also offer mechanisms for accessing the available data sources.

In this thesis, we present the architecture and implementation of a system
for deploying Timely Dataflow applications. Timely Dataflow is an existing
framework for writing distributed, data-parallel dataflow programs, with
support for iterative and incremental computations.
Our system manages the submission and execution of such Timely Dataflow programs
in a dynamic cluster of machines. It provides an introspection mechanism
which allows computations to inspect the current system state.
We extend Timely Dataflow with operators for sharing data streams between
different dataflow computations, enabling the composition of separately submitted
programs.

We evaluate our system by demonstrating that it can be used to
modularize and execute an application which performs statistical
processing of reconstructed user-sessions on log traces from a large datacenter.
