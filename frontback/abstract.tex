\chapter*{Abstract}

Online processing of data streams from different sources is an increasingly
common task in many applications. Running such kind of applications requires
platforms which not only supervise the deployment and execution of different
computational tasks, but also provide mechanisms to manage and share the
available data streams.

In this thesis, we present a system for managing the submission and execution
of Timely Dataflow applications. Timely Dataflow is an existing framework for
writing distributed, data-parallel dataflow programs with support for writing
iterative and incremental computations. Our system extends Timely Dataflow
with a mechanism for sharing data streams between different dataflow computations,
enabling the composition of separately submitted programs. We evaluate our system
by demonstrating it can be used to modularize and and execute an application
performing statistical processing of reconstructed user-sessions on
log traces from a large datacenter.
