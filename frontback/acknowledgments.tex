\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank Prof. Timothy Roscoe, not only for providing me with the
opportunity to work on this project, but also for his guidance along the way.

My thanks also goes to my supervisors, Dr. Desislava Dimitrova and Dr. John Liagouris.
This work would not have been possible without their great support and invaluable feedback.

Finally, I would like to thank Andrea Lattuada and Zaheer Chothia, as their
initial inputs have gained me a better understanding of the particularities
of Timely Dataflow.
